## 1. Introduction
**AnatoMaskGAN** implements the ideas presented in the paper  
*“AnatoMaskGAN: GNN-Driven Slice Feature Fusion and Noise Augmentation for Medical Semantic Image Synthesis”* [(arXiv:2508.11375)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11375).

This project focuses on medical semantic image synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  
It introduces novel strategies to improve anatomical realism and inter-slice consistency.

**Key Contributions:**
- 💠 **GNN-Based Slice Feature Fusion:** Captures inter-slice anatomical relationships using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
- 🌀 **3D Spatial Noise Injection:** Enhances structure diversity by injecting spatial noise during generation.
- 🧩 **Grayscale–Texture Classifier:** Refines intensity distribution and texture fidelity.
- 🧠 **Cross-Dataset Generalization:** Demonstrated on L2R-OASIS and L2R-Abdomen CT datasets with significant performance gains over SOTA.

## 2. Features
- Supports both *Mask → Image* and *Image → Mask* generation tasks.  
- Incorporates **multi-slice GNN fusion** and **3D noise augmentation**.  
- Optional **texture classifier** for perceptual quality improvement.  
- Unified training, testing, and inference pipelines.  
- YAML-based configuration for flexible experiment setup.  
- Open-source under the **MIT License**.

## 4. Usage

### 4.1 Training
```bash
python train.py --opt options/train.yml
```
Common arguments:
| Argument               | Description                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--dataset`            | Dataset name (e.g., L2R-OASIS)     |
| `--use_noise3d`        | Enable 3D noise injection          |
| `--use_gnn_fusion`     | Enable slice fusion via GNN        |
| `--texture_classifier` | Enable texture classifier          |
| `--save_dir`           | Directory for checkpoints and logs |




### 4.2 Testing / Generation
```bash
python test.py --opt options/test.yml --model_path checkpoints/latest_net_G.pth
```
-Results (images, masks, metrics) will be saved under the results/ directory.


### 4.3 Inference (Deployment)
```bash
python create.py --opt options/create.yml --input_path my_masks/ --output_path my_images/
```
-Generates new medical images from given semantic masks.

## 5. Model Architecture
AnatoMaskGAN consists of the following core modules:
- Generator (G): Takes a mask and neighboring slice features to synthesize the target image.
- Discriminator (D): Distinguishes real vs. generated images.
- GNN-Fusion Module: Models inter-slice dependency using a graph convolutional structure.
- 3D Noise Injection: Adds spatial perturbations to enhance structure variation.
- Grayscale–Texture Classifier: Improves texture and intensity realism.

Loss functions include adversarial loss, reconstruction loss (L1/L2), texture loss, and perceptual structure loss (e.g., LPIPS).

## 6. Experimental Results & Metrics
As reported in the paper:
| Dataset       | PSNR ↑       | SSIM ↑     | Improvement |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| L2R-OASIS     | **26.50 dB** | 0.857      | +0.43 dB    |
| L2R-AbdomenCT | 25.47 dB     | **0.8602** | +0.48 %     |

Ablation studies confirm that removing any module (GNN, Noise, Classifier) degrades performance across all metrics.

## 7. FAQ
- Q1. Can it be applied to MRI or other modalities?
  
Yes, as long as the dataset has slice-wise correspondence and semantic masks.
- Q2. Generated images look blurry.

Check if --use_gnn_fusion is enabled or reduce noise intensity.

Training longer or tuning the learning rate may also help.
- Q3. Small dataset?
  
Apply data augmentation (flips, rotations, slice sampling) to improve generalization.
- Q4. Training is slow.
  
Try lowering batch_size, reducing GNN depth, or using a GPU with more memory.
